# Example: optimizing an ADK agent with Genetic-Pareto

This directory contains an example demonstrating how to use the Agent Development
Kit (ADK) to run and optimize an LLM-based agent in a simulated environment with the Genetic-Pareto prompt optimization algorithm ([GEPA: Reflective Prompt Evolution Can Outperform Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457)) on benchmarks like Tau-bench.
