  This tool writes content to multiple files. It's designed for creating
  Python tools, callbacks, configuration files, and other code files.

  Args:
    files: Dict mapping file_path to content to write
    create_backup: Whether to create backups of existing files (default: False)
    create_directories: Whether to create parent directories (default: True)

  Returns:
    Dict containing write operation results:
      - success: bool indicating if all writes succeeded
      - files: dict mapping file_path to file info:
        - file_size: size of written file in bytes
        - existed_before: bool indicating if file existed before write
        - backup_created: bool indicating if backup was created
        - backup_path: path to backup file if created
        - error: error message if write failed for this file
      - successful_writes: number of files written successfully
