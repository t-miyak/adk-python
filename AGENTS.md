# AI Coding Assistant Context

This document provides context for AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) to understand the ADK Python project and assist with development.

## Project Overview

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is an open-source, code-first Python toolkit for building, evaluating, and deploying sophisticated AI agents with flexibility and control. While optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem, ADK is model-agnostic, deployment-agnostic, and is built for compatibility with other frameworks. ADK was designed to make agent development feel more like software development, to make it easier for developers to create, deploy, and orchestrate agentic architectures that range from simple tasks to complex workflows.

### Key Components

- **Agent** - Blueprint defining identity, instructions, and tools (`LlmAgent`, `LoopAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, `SequentialAgent`, etc.)
- **Runner** - Execution engine that orchestrates the "Reason-Act" loop, manages LLM calls, executes tools, and handles multi-agent coordination
- **Tool** - Functions/capabilities agents can call (Python functions, OpenAPI specs, MCP tools, Google API tools)
- **Session** - Conversation state management (in-memory, Vertex AI, Spanner-backed)
- **Memory** - Long-term recall across sessions

## Project Architecture

### ADK Live (Bidi-streaming)

- ADK live feature can be accessed from runner.run_live(...) and corresponding FAST api endpoint.
- ADK live feature is built on top of [Gemini Live API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/live-api). We integrate Gemini Live API through [GenAI SDK](https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai).
- ADK live related configs are in [run_config.py](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/agents/run_config.py).
- ADK live under multi-agent scenario: we convert the audio into text. This text will be passed to next agent as context.
- Most logics are in [base_llm_flow.py](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/flows/llm_flows/base_llm_flow.py) and [gemini_llm_connection.py](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/models/gemini_llm_connection.py).
- Input transcription and output transcription should be added to session as Event.
- User audio or model audio should be saved into artifacts with a reference in Event to it.
- Tests are in [tests/unittests/streaming](https://github.com/google/adk-python/tree/main/tests/unittests/streaming).

### Agent Structure Convention (Required)

**All agent directories must follow this structure:**
```
my_agent/
├── __init__.py      # MUST contain: from . import agent
└── agent.py         # MUST define: root_agent = Agent(...) OR app = App(...)
```

**Choose one pattern based on your needs:**

**Option 1 - Simple Agent (for basic agents without plugins):**
```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search

root_agent = Agent(
    name="search_assistant",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant.",
    description="An assistant that can search the web.",
    tools=[google_search]
)
```

**Option 2 - App Pattern (when you need plugins, event compaction, custom configuration):**
```python
from google.adk import Agent
from google.adk.apps import App
from google.adk.plugins import ContextFilterPlugin

root_agent = Agent(
    name="my_agent",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant.",
    tools=[...],
)

app = App(
    name="my_app",
    root_agent=root_agent,
    plugins=[
        ContextFilterPlugin(num_invocations_to_keep=3),
    ],
)
```

**Rationale:** This structure allows the ADK CLI (`adk web`, `adk run`, etc.) to automatically discover and load agents without additional configuration.

## Development Setup

### Requirements

**Minimum requirements:**
- Python 3.9+ (**Python 3.11+ strongly recommended** for best performance)
- `uv` package manager (**required** - faster than pip/venv)

**Install uv if not already installed:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Setup Instructions

**Standard setup for development:**
```bash
# Create virtual environment with Python 3.11
uv venv --python "python3.11" ".venv"
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install all dependencies for development
uv sync --all-extras
```

**Minimal setup for testing only (matches CI):**
```bash
uv sync --extra test --extra eval --extra a2a
```

**Virtual Environment Usage (Required):**
- **Always use** `.venv/bin/python` or `.venv/bin/pytest` directly
- **Or activate** with `source .venv/bin/activate` before running commands
- **Never use** `python -m venv` - always create with `uv venv` if missing

**Rationale:** `uv` is significantly faster and ensures consistent dependency resolution across the team.

### Building

```bash
# Build wheel
uv build

# Install local build for testing
pip install dist/google_adk-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
```

### Running Agents Locally

**For interactive development and debugging:**
```bash
# Launch web UI (recommended for development)
adk web path/to/agents_dir
```

**For CLI-based testing:**
```bash
# Interactive CLI (prompts for user input)
adk run path/to/my_agent
```

**For API/production mode:**
```bash
# Start FastAPI server
adk api_server path/to/agents_dir
```

**For running evaluations:**
```bash
# Run evaluation set against agent
adk eval path/to/my_agent path/to/eval_set.json
```

## ADK: Style Guides

### Python Style Guide

The project follows the Google Python Style Guide. Key conventions are enforced using `pylint` with the provided `pylintrc` configuration file. Here are some of the key style points:

*   **Indentation**: 2 spaces.
*   **Line Length**: Maximum 80 characters.
*   **Naming Conventions**:
    *   `function_and_variable_names`: `snake_case`
    *   `ClassNames`: `CamelCase`
    *   `CONSTANTS`: `UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE`
*   **Docstrings**: Required for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods.
*   **Imports**: Organized and sorted.
*   **Error Handling**: Specific exceptions should be caught, not general ones like `Exception`.

### Autoformat (Required Before Committing)

**Always run** before committing code:
```bash
./autoformat.sh
```

**Manual formatting** (if needed):
```bash
# Format imports
isort src/ tests/ contributing/

# Format code style
pyink --config pyproject.toml src/ tests/ contributing/
```

**Check formatting** without making changes:
```bash
pyink --check --diff --config pyproject.toml src/
isort --check src/
```

**Formatting Standards (Enforced by CI):**
- **Formatter:** `pyink` (Google-style Python formatter)
- **Line length:** 80 characters maximum
- **Indentation:** 2 spaces (never tabs)
- **Import sorter:** `isort` with Google profile
- **Linter:** `pylint` with Google Python Style Guide

**Rationale:** Consistent formatting eliminates style debates and makes code reviews focus on logic rather than style.

### In ADK source

Below styles applies to the ADK source code (under `src/` folder of the Github repo).

#### Use relative imports (Required)

```python
# DO - Use relative imports
from ..agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent

# DON'T - No absolute imports
from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent
```

**Rationale:** Relative imports make the code more maintainable and avoid circular import issues in large codebases.

#### Import from module, not from `__init__.py` (Required)

```python
# DO - Import directly from module
from ..agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent

# DON'T - Import from __init__.py
from ..agents import LlmAgent
```

**Rationale:** Direct module imports make dependencies explicit and improve IDE navigation and refactoring.

#### Always do `from __future__ import annotations` (Required)

**Rule:** Every source file must include `from __future__ import annotations` immediately after the license header, before any other imports.

```python
# Copyright 2025 Google LLC
#
# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
# You may obtain a copy of the License at
#
#     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
#
# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software
# distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,
# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.
# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and
# limitations under the License.

from __future__ import annotations  # REQUIRED - Always include this

# ... rest of imports ...
```

**Rationale:** This enables forward-referencing classes without quotes, improving code readability and type hint support (PEP 563).

### In ADK tests

#### Use absolute imports (Required)

**Rule:** Test code must use absolute imports (`google.adk.*`) to match how users import ADK.

```python
# DO - Use absolute imports
from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent

# DON'T - No relative imports in tests
from ..agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent
```

**Rationale:** Tests should exercise the same import paths that users will use, catching issues with the public API.

## ADK: Local Testing

### Unit Tests

**Quick start:** Run all tests with:
```bash
pytest tests/unittests
```

**Recommended:** Match CI configuration before submitting PRs:
```bash
uv sync --extra test --extra eval --extra a2a && pytest tests/unittests
```

**Additional options:**
```bash
# Run tests in parallel for faster execution
pytest tests/unittests -n auto

# Run a specific test file during development
pytest tests/unittests/agents/test_llm_agent.py

# Python 3.9 compatibility mode (excludes features requiring 3.10+)
pytest tests/unittests \
  --ignore=tests/unittests/a2a \
  --ignore=tests/unittests/tools/mcp_tool \
  --ignore=tests/unittests/artifacts/test_artifact_service.py
```

### Testing Philosophy

**Use real code over mocks:** ADK tests should use real implementations as much as possible instead of mocking. Only mock external dependencies like network calls or cloud services.

**Test interface behavior, not implementation details:** Tests should verify that the public API behaves correctly, not how it's implemented internally. This makes tests resilient to refactoring and ensures the contract with users remains intact.

**Test Requirements:**
- Fast and isolated tests where possible
- Use real ADK components; mock only external dependencies (LLM APIs, cloud services, etc.)
- Focus on testing public interfaces and behavior, not internal implementation
- Descriptive test names that explain what behavior is being tested
- High coverage for new features, edge cases, and error conditions
- Location: `tests/unittests/` following source structure

## Docstring and comments

### Comments - Explaining the Why, Not the What
Philosophy: Well-written code should be largely self-documenting. Comments
 serve a different purpose: they should explain the complex algorithms,
 non-obvious business logic, or the rationale behind a particular implementation
 choice—the things the code cannot express on its own. Avoid comments that
 merely restate what the code does (e.g., # increment i above i += 1).

Style: Comments should be written as complete sentences. Block comments must
begin with a # followed by a single space.

## Versioning
ADK adherence to Semantic Versioning 2.0.0

Core Principle: The adk-python project strictly adheres to the Semantic
Versioning 2.0.0 specification. All release versions will follow the
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

### Breaking Change

A breaking change is any modification that introduces backward-incompatible
changes to the public API. In the context of the ADK, this means a change that
could force a developer using the framework to alter their existing code to
upgrade to the new version. The public API is not limited to just the Python
function and class signatures; it also encompasses data schemas for stored
information (like evaluation datasets), the command-line interface (CLI),
and the data format used for server communications.

### Public API Surface Definition

The "public API" of ADK is a broad contract that extends beyond its Python
function signatures. A breaking change in any of the following areas can
disrupt user workflows and the wider ecosystem of agents and tools built with
ADK. The analysis of the breaking changes introduced in v1.0.0 demonstrates the
expansive nature of this contract. For the purposes of versioning, the ADK
Public API Surface is defined as:

- All public classes, methods, and functions in the google.adk namespace.

- The names, required parameters, and expected behavior of all built-in Tools
 (e.g., google_search, BuiltInCodeExecutor).

- The structure and schema of persisted data, including Session data, Memory,
 and Evaluation datasets.

- The JSON request/response format of the ADK API server(FastAPI server)
 used by adk web, including field casing conventions.

- The command-line interface (CLI) commands, arguments, and flags (e.g., adk deploy).

- The expected file structure for agent definitions that are loaded by the
 framework (e.g., the agent.py convention).

#### Checklist for Breaking Changes:

The following changes are considered breaking and necessitate a MAJOR version
 bump.

- API Signature Change: Renaming, removing, or altering the required parameters
 of any public class, method, or function (e.g., the removal of the list_events
 method from BaseSessionService).

- Architectural Shift: A fundamental change to a core component's behavior
 (e.g., making all service methods async, which requires consumers to use await).

- Data Schema Change: A non-additive change to a persisted data schema that
 renders old data unreadable or invalid (e.g., the redesign of the
  MemoryService and evaluation dataset schemas).

- Tool Interface Change: Renaming a built-in tool, changing its required
 parameters, or altering its fundamental purpose (e.g., replacing
 BuiltInCodeExecutionTool with BuiltInCodeExecutor and moving it from the tools
 parameter to the code_executor parameter of an Agent).

- Configuration Change: Altering the required structure of configuration files
 or agent definition files that the framework loads (e.g., the simplification
 of the agent.py structure for MCPToolset).

- Wire Format Change: Modifying the data format for API server interactions
 (e.g., the switch from snake_case to camelCase for all JSON payloads).

- Dependency Removal: Removing support for a previously integrated third-party
 library or tool type.

## Commit Message Format (Required)

**All commits must** follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.

**Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Common types:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`

**Examples:**
```
feat(agents): Add support for App pattern with plugins

fix(sessions): Prevent memory leak in session cleanup

refactor(tools): Unify environment variable enabled checks
```

**Rationale:** Conventional commits enable automated changelog generation and version management.
